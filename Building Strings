-->Syntax:string variableName = "puppy";
-->Escape Character Sequences:
string withoutSlash = "Ifemelu said, "Hello!"";
string withSlash = "Ifemelu said, \"Hello!\"";
--> \n means new line 
Example:
using System;
namespace PrideAndPrejudice
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      // First string variable
      string firstSentence="It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.";
      // Second string variable
      string firstSpeech="\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\"";
      // Print variable and newline
      Console.WriteLine(firstSentence);
      Console.WriteLine("\n");
      Console.WriteLine(firstSpeech);
    }
  }
}
Output:
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.


"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"

-->String Concatenation:"+" operator
-->string interpolation, which enables us to insert our variable values and expressions in the middle of a string, without needing to consider spaces and punctuation separately.
Example:
using System;
namespace StoryTime
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      // Declare the variables
      string beginning = "Once upon a time,";
      string middle = "The kid climbed a tree";
      string end = "Everyone lived happily ever after.";

      // Interpolate the string and the variables
      string story=$"{beginning} {middle}, and {end}";

      // Print the story to the console 
      Console.WriteLine(story);
    }
  }
}
Output:Once upon a time, The kid climbed a tree, and Everyone lived happily ever after.
