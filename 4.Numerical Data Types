Example:
Several large pizza chains employ C# developers. Letâ€™s imagine that you work for the chain, Giant Brutus. Your boss gives you some data and wants you to enter it into a C# program.
CODE:
using System;
namespace Numbers
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      // Number of pizza shops
       int pizzaShops=4332;
      // Number of employees
       int totalEmployees=86928;
      // Revenue
      decimal revenue=390819.28m;
      // Log the values to the console:
      Console.WriteLine(pizzaShops);
      Console.WriteLine(totalEmployees);
      Console.WriteLine(revenue);
   	}
  }
}
