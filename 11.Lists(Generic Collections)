-->A list, or List<T>, is a generic, sequential data structure. The specific type that it contains is specified upon instantiation.
->The list class is in a group of generic collections. They donâ€™t exist in the default set of System classes, so we need to reference them with this line.
->Generic collections are data structures that are defined with a generic type. Each class is defined generally without a specific type in mind. When we make an actual instance, 
we define the specific type:
List<string> citiesList = new List<string>();
List<Object> objects = new List<Object>();
