-->C# is a Valuable Skill, its robust design and the popularity of frameworks supporting the language, C# is an incredibly versatile tool for a wide range of applications. 
Mastering C# enables you to develop chat applications, financial trading programs, medical record systems, and many other types of software.
->Basic c# code:
using System;
namespace Pujitha
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Pujitha!");    
     }
  }
}

Inside, the Program class contains the Main method, which is the entry point of the program. The Console.WriteLine("Pujitha!"); line prints “Pujitha!” to the console.
